##Two ways to run
##you may run this by invoking
##$ python routh_hurwitz.py a2 a1 a0
##from the command line where a2 a1 a0 are the coefficients of the char poly
##or you may edit the string below

varin = '1 3.51 (0.878+0.25*k_2) (0.05471+0.109*k_2+0.25*k_1) 0.109*k_1' ##change this to the coefficients of your char poly if
##you are not using the command line
